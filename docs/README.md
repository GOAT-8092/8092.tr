   ```

2. Set your local values in `.env`:
   ```env
   PORTAL_PASS=your_portal_password_here
   ```

### Production Deployment

The following environment variables must be configured in your deployment environment:

- `PORTAL_PASS`: Password for team portal access

**GitHub Repository Secrets:**

- Set `PORTAL_PASS` as a repository secret in GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Important Considerations

1. **Images**: 177+ team member and event photos with consistent naming convention
2. **Turkish Content**: All content is in Turkish - maintain proper encoding and localization
3. **Gallery Dependencies**: Fancybox requires jQuery and specific data attributes
4. **Mobile Menu**: JavaScript toggle functionality for mobile navigation
5. **Smooth Scroll**: Custom scroll functions preserve original UX
6. **Image Management**: Use provided scripts for批量 renaming and reference updates
7. **Vercel Optimization**: No manual image optimization needed - handled automatically

### Image Naming Convention

- **Team Members**: `team-[firstname]-[role].jpg` (e.g., `team-halil-captain.jpg`)
- **Gallery Images**: `general-2024-[number].jpg` (e.g., `general-2024-04.jpg`)
- **Logos**: `logo-[organization].png` (e.g., `logo-frc.png`)
- **Turkish Characters**: Automatically normalized (ı→i, ğ→g, ü→u, ş→s, ö→o, ç→c)

### Contributing

This project follows FIRST values of **Gracious Professionalism** and **Coopertition**. When contributing:

- Maintain code quality and accessibility standards
- Follow the existing TypeScript patterns
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test gallery functionality thoroughly
- Preserve Turkish language content accuracy
